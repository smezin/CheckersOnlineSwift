# CheckersOnlineSwift

This is a swift client for checkers game, made for 2 remote players.<br>
The client communicates with a NodeJS server, the one that is in my "basic-game-server" repo.<br>
App design keeps distinct seperation between ui and logic.<br>
App allows to play one Vs one or one Vs many from a single device.<br>

Things to improve:<br>
Changes Socket.IO server communication to higher stability solution.<br>
Create game persistance/save game checkpoint ability
